[h3]Features:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]All switches are animated and can be clicked in-game.
    [*]Control ANY amount of scenery objects with ANY amount lights with a single switch!
    [*]Multi-switch solutions can control different groups of light objects.
    [*]Switches can be used purely aesthetically and do not have to be connected to any lights if desired.
    [*]Choose if the switch & lights should be on or off when the simulation starts.
    [*]Choose an optional amount of time for the lights to flicker/warm up when the switch is turned on.
    [*]Choose a sound effect for the switch to play when it is turned on or off, or use the default sounds included with the pack.
    [*]For the breaker switches, choose an optional coaster to E-Stop when the switch is turned off.
    [*]Choose an optional override interval that will force the light(s) to match the switch's state, even if the light's own script told it to do otherwise (ex. vanilla lights turn on at night even though the switch is set to off).
	[*][NEW] Breaker-style switches have an extra "inverse" light group setting that can allow for certain lights to turn on when the switch is off (like "emergency lights").
[/list]

A README.html (that you can open in your browser) with details on how to use the pack is also included with the pack.

[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]All vanilla NL2 scenery object lights.
    [*]Any un-scripted 3rd party custom scenery objects (SCOs) with any amount of lights.
    [*]MOST scripted 3rd party lights (ie. animated lights, track lights, etc.) can be made to work with the right settings, but results will vary. The switch's "Override Interval" and "Disable Entity Color Changing" settings can be used in effort to increase compatibility.
    [*]Coaster running lights unfortunately cannot be controlled due to NL2 limitations.
